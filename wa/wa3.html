    <img src = "../img/dead.jpg">
    <p>Dead & Company is an American rock band. It formed in 2015 with a lineup of former Grateful Dead members Bob Weir (guitar and vocals), Mickey Hart (drums), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums), along with John Mayer (guitar and vocals), Oteil Burbridge (bass, percussion, and vocals),[1] and Jeff Chimenti (keyboards).[2][3][4] In 2023 Jay Lane replaced Kreutzmann as the band's second drummer for their final tour.[5]
        After finishing the "Final Tour," John Mayer reassured fans that "Dead & Company is still a band," but that they did not "know what the next show will be."[6]</p>

            <p>Mayer recounts that in 2011 he was listening to Pandora and happened upon the song "Althea" by the Grateful Dead, and that soon Grateful Dead music was all he would listen to.[7] In February 2015, while Mayer was guest hosting The Late Late Show, he invited Grateful Dead guitar player Bob Weir to join him in a studio performance. A bond developed between the two, and while Weir and the other three surviving core members of the Grateful Dead were preparing for their 50th anniversary shows, dubbed Fare Thee Well, Mayer began practicing the band's large catalog of songs. That August, Mayer and original Grateful Dead members Weir, Hart, and Kreutzmann formed the band, along with keyboardist Jeff Chimenti (Furthur, RatDog) and bassist Oteil Burbridge (Allman Brothers Band, Aquarium Rescue Unit). Mayer expressed a particularly strong enthusiasm toward playing with the new band.[8][9]
            Phil Lesh, the bassist for the Grateful Dead, did not join Dead & Company. Instead he continued to perform with his band Phil Lesh and Friends.[10][11] Mike Gordon of Phish was pursued for the bassist role but had to withdraw due to being too busy with other matters.[8]</p>

I'm done with that kind of touring."[20]
