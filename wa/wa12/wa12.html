      For this project, I extended the functionality of the quote machine in several ways. Firstly, I integrated a new API to fetch quotes, I used a Dad Joke API. This API provides new Dad Jokes everytime you press the button. 

      In terms of design, I made changes to the CSS to create a unique visual experience. The color palette now features calming greens and blues. The font styles have been adjusted for improved readability and a modern look.

      Additionally, I introduced a couple of features to enhance user interaction. Users now have the ability to share their favorite quotes on Twitter with the "Tweet Quote" button. Moreover, a loading indicator has been implemented, providing visual feedback when a new quote is being fetched.

      Lastly, to add a personal touch, I included images of the quoted individuals. This feature not only adds a visual element but also allows users to connect more personally with the quotes.

      I hope you enjoy the updated quote machine, and feel free to explore the diverse range of quotes and features!
