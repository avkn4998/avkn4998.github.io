        <h4>Beethoven's Fifth Symphony with Peter Oundjian</h4>
        <p>SEP 15th-17th <br>
            FRI-SAT at 7:30pm <br>
            SUN at 1:00pm</p>
<p>Our Centennial Celebration begins with Beethoven under the baton of Principal Conductor Peter Oundjian with acclaimed masterworks commemorating a century of symphonic music in Colorado. Superstar pianist Hélène Grimaud lends her prodigious talents to Brahms’ First Piano Concerto, filled with virtuosic beauty and bombast in equal measure while featuring many an homage to his idol, Beethoven.
As a musician confronting the fate of impending deafness, Beethoven persisted while documenting hopeful aspirations to prevail in his music and personal journals. Within his monumental Fifth Symphony — perhaps the most recognizable and well-known composition in the classical repertoire — he famously depicts this struggle with the ominous four-note motif signifying “fate knocking at the door.”
Today, Carlos Simon takes inspiration from a journal entry written a decade after the Fifth Symphony, which includes a passage from Homer’s Iliad, beginning, “But Fate now conquers...” Taken together, we witness as Beethoven grapples against inevitability before ultimately relinquishing himself to the hands of fate.

<p>SEP 29th-OCT1st <br>
    FRI-SAT at 7:30 <br>
     SUN at 1:00pm</p> 
<p>Welcome the Colorado Symphony’s former Music Director Jeffrey Kahane in his return to Boettcher Concert Hall both as featured soloist and conductor on Beethoven’s sublime Fourth Piano Concerto. In the hands of Kahane, an intimate dialogue between the solo piano and the instrumental voices of the orchestra emerges with striking clarity and drama. Kahane then takes the podium to conduct Rachmaninoff’s Third and final Symphony, which features the composer’s trademark lush melodies and romantic flair, a spellbinding conclusion to an evening of symphonic bliss.</p>

            The lives and music of Dmitri Shostakovich and Aram Khachaturian were unquestionably influenced by their shared sociopolitical climate as composers in the Soviet Union. Shostakovich’s Fifth Symphony, which he called “a response to my critics,” sprang forth during a time of tremendous oppression and conflict, leaving listeners to wonder whether the composition was a triumphant work of patriotism or a hidden note of subversion against the oppression of Stalin. Serbian violinist Nemanja Radulović has taken the classical music world by storm with his extraordinary virtuosity, which will be on full display in Khachaturian’s Violin Concerto, an exhilarating work full of Armenian folk flourishes and a hypnotically beautiful second movement. It’s all led by orchestra favorite Jaime Martín, on loan from his post as Music Director of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra.

        <h4>Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 6 with Peter Oundjian</h4> </p>

             FRI-SAT at 7:30pm <br>
             SUN at 1:00pm</p>
        <p>In Tchaikovsky’s native Russia, “pathétique” suggests impassioned suffering, an eerily suitable description for the psychological drama depicted in his final symphony. His death only nine days after the symphony’s premiere gives added weight to this defining work of the Romantic period.
            Listen to an instrument of the orchestra like you've never heard it before as our own Principal Clarinet, Jason Shafer, performs John Corigliano’s electric and dazzling Clarinet Concerto, a live spectacle that will enthrall Classical, Jazz, and Rock 'n' Roll lovers alike.
            The performance opens with Beethoven’s Overture to Egmont, showing the icon at his most forceful in a piece full of trademark orchestral power led by Principal Conductor Peter Oundjian.</p>

    <p>A season-long celebration of our renowned Colorado Symphony Chorus begins, commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the ensemble with their founder and director, Duain Wolfe, conducting Gary Fry’s To Dream Again, Vaughan Williams’ Serenade to Music, and Bruckner’s Psalm 150.
        On the second half, Resident Conductor Christopher Dragon takes the podium on Schumann’s gorgeous Third Symphony, an awe-inspiring musical portrait he composed while reveling in the picturesque landscape of Düsseldorf and the majestic Rhine River. Here Schumann brilliantly evokes a folk-like atmosphere with surging music that seems more like a force of nature—perhaps channeling the River Rhine itself.</p>

        Your Colorado Symphony and Colorado Symphony Chorus, plus a star-studded cast of vocal soloists, welcome former Music Director and current Conductor Laureate Marin Alsop for an evening of masterpieces that are sure to delight and inspire. Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony — so often enlisted for its brilliance, magnitude, and thematic potency — has endured for almost two centuries as the greatest artwork about peace, freedom for all, and brotherhood, ever created.
        This grand hymn to humanity will flourish alongside two contemporary works by female composers in Anna Clyne’s Dance for Cello and Orchestra and Reena Esmail’s See Me, all under the baton of the legendary Maestra Alsop.

    <p> Stravinsky’s The Firebird has captivated listeners for over a century, masterfully blurring the lines between fantasy and reality. The ballet’s myth-like storyline features a magical Firebird, who helps a young prince rescue a coterie of princesses from Kashchey, an evil sorcerer. Stravinsky’s brilliant orchestrations paint a colorful musical portrait in this masterpiece that is truly dance made audible.
        From the mind of Danny Elfman — legend of contemporary film music whose scores have fused pop culture with the Romantic tradition — comes a brand-new Percussion Concerto for orchestra featuring the electrifying Colin Currie – as one critic put it, "surely the world’s finest and most daring percussionist." These works will spring to life in the hands of Resident Conductor Christopher Dragon in a performance that will enchant from the first note to the last.

    Witness Mozart’s final and greatest masterpiece with Principal Conductor Peter Oundjian, your Colorado Symphony, and Colorado Symphony Chorus. The Requiem’s genesis is shrouded in mystery – one that makes the piece all the more fascinating and emotionally stirring. Composed while on the edge of consciousness, Mozart willed his last creation into life with his final breaths, bestowing upon the world a choral tour de force that remains remarkably poignant to this day.
Immerse yourself in this exalted Requiem alongside two quintessentially French compositions in Fauré’s Pavane — a stunning take on a 16th century Spanish court dance — and Debussy’s Nocturnes, rounding out a performance that will leave you awe struck.

        Discussing aspirations for his next symphony, Mahler wrote, “One is, so to speak, only an instrument, played on by the universe. The symphony must be like the world. It must embrace everything!” No Mahler symphony gives us a greater sense of this cosmic scale than the Third.
        This great hymn to nature is massive in scale requiring a colossal orchestra and set in six movements in sequence from the earthly and mundane to the sublime and heavenly. Featuring brilliant mezzo-soprano Michelle DeYoung, Women of the Colorado Symphony Chorus, and the Colorado Children’s Chorale, this is an epic performance as only Mahler and your Colorado Symphony can deliver.

    For much of his life, Johannes Brahms felt the omnipresent weight of Beethoven’s shadow looming over him but by the time he reached this, his third and perhaps most stirring symphony, he had emphatically found his own unique voice and flourished into an icon in his own right. The Third is richly Romantic, featuring sweeping, lyrical string lines and beautifully autumnal woodwind passages that make this symphony a delight from start to finish.
Electrifying violinist Stefan Jackiw — called “...one of the most insightful violinists of his generation” by The Boston Globe — lends his athletic virtuosity to Prokofiev’s Second Violin Concerto which features a lively and dance-like final movement that will leap off the stage under the baton of Jun Märkl</p>

    <p>
        Musically recreating a day’s mountain climb, it begins in the hours before sunrise, which are painted in dark and somber tones before the brassy emergence of the sun sets the climbers on their way to a rhythmic, rising theme. A grand trombone fanfare and rich orchestral passages create the glorious panorama revealed at the summit while the descent is represented by falling intervals and a clever inversion of the rising theme heard during the ascent. Back at the mountain’s base, night has come as Strauss brings the listener full circle.
