        <h4>Beethoven's Fifth Symphony with Peter Oundjian</h4>
        <p>SEP 15th-17th <br>
            FRI-SAT at 7:30pm <br>
            SUN at 1:00pm</p>
<p>Our Centennial Celebration begins with Beethoven under the baton of Principal Conductor Peter Oundjian with acclaimed masterworks commemorating a century of symphonic music in Colorado. Superstar pianist Hélène Grimaud lends her prodigious talents to Brahms’ First Piano Concerto, filled with virtuosic beauty and bombast in equal measure while featuring many an homage to his idol, Beethoven.
As a musician confronting the fate of impending deafness, Beethoven persisted while documenting hopeful aspirations to prevail in his music and personal journals. Within his monumental Fifth Symphony — perhaps the most recognizable and well-known composition in the classical repertoire — he famously depicts this struggle with the ominous four-note motif signifying “fate knocking at the door.”
Today, Carlos Simon takes inspiration from a journal entry written a decade after the Fifth Symphony, which includes a passage from Homer’s Iliad, beginning, “But Fate now conquers...” Taken together, we witness as Beethoven grapples against inevitability before ultimately relinquishing himself to the hands of fate.

<p>SEP 29-OCT1 <br>
    FRI-SAT at 7:30 <br>
     SUN at 1:00</p> 
<p>Welcome the Colorado Symphony’s former Music Director Jeffrey Kahane in his return to Boettcher Concert Hall both as featured soloist and conductor on Beethoven’s sublime Fourth Piano Concerto. In the hands of Kahane, an intimate dialogue between the solo piano and the instrumental voices of the orchestra emerges with striking clarity and drama. Kahane then takes the podium to conduct Rachmaninoff’s Third and final Symphony, which features the composer’s trademark lush melodies and romantic flair, a spellbinding conclusion to an evening of symphonic bliss.</p>

            The lives and music of Dmitri Shostakovich and Aram Khachaturian were unquestionably influenced by their shared sociopolitical climate as composers in the Soviet Union. Shostakovich’s Fifth Symphony, which he called “a response to my critics,” sprang forth during a time of tremendous oppression and conflict, leaving listeners to wonder whether the composition was a triumphant work of patriotism or a hidden note of subversion against the oppression of Stalin. Serbian violinist Nemanja Radulović has taken the classical music world by storm with his extraordinary virtuosity, which will be on full display in Khachaturian’s Violin Concerto, an exhilarating work full of Armenian folk flourishes and a hypnotically beautiful second movement. It’s all led by orchestra favorite Jaime Martín, on loan from his post as Music Director of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra.

        <p>In Tchaikovsky’s native Russia, “pathétique” suggests impassioned suffering, an eerily suitable description for the psychological drama depicted in his final symphony. His death only nine days after the symphony’s premiere gives added weight to this defining work of the Romantic period.
            Listen to an instrument of the orchestra like you've never heard it before as our own Principal Clarinet, Jason Shafer, performs John Corigliano’s electric and dazzling Clarinet Concerto, a live spectacle that will enthrall Classical, Jazz, and Rock 'n' Roll lovers alike.
            The performance opens with Beethoven’s Overture to Egmont, showing the icon at his most forceful in a piece full of trademark orchestral power led by Principal Conductor Peter Oundjian.</p>

    <p>A season-long celebration of our renowned Colorado Symphony Chorus begins, commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the ensemble with their founder and director, Duain Wolfe, conducting Gary Fry’s To Dream Again, Vaughan Williams’ Serenade to Music, and Bruckner’s Psalm 150.
        On the second half, Resident Conductor Christopher Dragon takes the podium on Schumann’s gorgeous Third Symphony, an awe-inspiring musical portrait he composed while reveling in the picturesque landscape of Düsseldorf and the majestic Rhine River. Here Schumann brilliantly evokes a folk-like atmosphere with surging music that seems more like a force of nature—perhaps channeling the River Rhine itself.</p>
